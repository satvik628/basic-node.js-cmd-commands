What is Node JS?

Node JS was first written in 2009 by Ryan Dahl. It is an open-source JavaScript Runtime environment based on Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine and used to develop web and mobile applications. It is also used for building APIs as well as back-end applications.

Why Node JS?

Unlike, Apache HTTP server, the most popular server of the time, it has an asynchronous nature, a lot of libraries (due to the wide range of developers contributing to it), and is also very useful in building real-time web and mobile applications (e.g.,chatting systems).

There are other uses and advantages for using Node as an application building tool, but it would be too long of a a list to put here.

Installing Node JS 

Node JS can be installed from the official Node website. By default, the website gives you the links needed to download Node for your current Operating System. It also gives you an option to download an LTS (Long-term Support) version and the current version. There is very little difference is very between the two versions and most functionalities of the are the same.

You can check the installation by opening Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on MacOS or Linux) and entering the command node --version. The command should output something .
